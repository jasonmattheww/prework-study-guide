# Jason's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This prework study guide is a place where I stored my notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It helped me stay orginized of each section, while it allows me to look back on later in the future for help on the material.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To employ this study guide, you can go over any section you would like and read about it. For instance let's say you forgot which branch you're in, you can type "git status" into your git which allows you to check which branch you're currently on. To create a entirely new branch type "git checkout -b 'branch-name'".
